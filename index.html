   <h1>25 Principles of Adult Behavior</h1>
    <p>
      Be patient. No matter what. 
      <span class="gray">Don’t badmouth: Assign responsibility, not blame. Say nothing of another you wouldn’t say to <!-- this said "him" but I changed it to "them" -->them.</span> 
      Never assume the motives of others are, to them, less noble than yours are to you. 
      <span class="gray">Expand your sense of the possible.</span> 
      Don’t trouble yourself with matters you truly cannot change. 
      <span class="gray">Expect no more of anyone than you can deliver yourself.</span> 
      Tolerate ambiguity. 
      <span class="gray">Laugh at yourself frequently.</span> 
      Concern yourself with what is right rather than who is right. 
      <span class="gray">Never forget that, no matter how certain, you might be wrong.</span>
      Give up blood sports. 
      <span class="gray">Remember that your life belongs to others as well. Don’t risk it frivolously.</span>
      Never lie to anyone for any reason. (Lies of omission are sometimes exempt.) 
      <span class="gray">Learn the needs of those around you and respect them.</span> 
      Avoid the pursuit of happiness. Seek to define your mission and pursue that. 
      <span class="gray">Reduce your use of the first personal pronoun.</span> 
      Praise at least as often as you disparage. 
      <span class="gray">Admit your errors freely and soon.</span> 
      Become less suspicious of joy.
      <span class="gray">Understand humility.</span> 
      Remember that love forgives everything. 
      <span class="gray">Foster dignity.</span>
      Live memorably. 
      <span class="gray">Love yourself.</span> 
      Endure. 
      <span class="red">John Barlow 1977</span>
